                      ANNOTATION DOCUMENT OF NON-ASSERTION

    Copyright [Year]; [Copyright Holder Name]. All Rights Reserved.

    ============================ OFFICIAL PLEDGE ===========================

     The following two sentences, comprising seventeen words, constitute the
    complete and authoritative Non-assertion.

                    EVERYONE CAN DO ANYTHING WITH THIS WORK.
                    ANY USE IS AT YOUR OWN RISK, IT'S AS IS.

     The Annotation Document of Non-Assertion (hereinafter referred to as
    this Document) provides an explanation of the aforementioned pledge.
    Both the official pledge and this Document are legally valid and possess
    equal legal effect. The Annotated Document serves to supplement the
    official pledge by providing additional legal specificity in situations
    requiring detailed interpretation.

    =============================== PREAMBLE ===============================

     Non-assertion is a pledge not to enforce copyright for all forms of
    creative work.

     In civil law jurisdictions, it is impossible for a copyright holder to
    relinquish their moral rights (hereinafter referred to as moral rights)
    over their own work. However, some individuals may wish to avoid having
    their name forgotten, or at the very least, to shield users from the
    legal fear of infringing moral rights. Furthermore, public domain
    declarations such as CC0 can eliminate the legal basis for the copyright
    holder to sanction malicious users who falsely assert copyright or
    commit fraud, thereby potentially threatening the copyright holder
    themselves or third parties.

     Accordingly, Non-assertion aims to permit users freedom of use
    equivalent to or comparable with the public domain, whilst the copyright
    holder retains ownership of their work but pledges not to assert their
    rights. This simultaneously preserves a legal basis for protecting
    against third-party attempts to falsely claim, usurp, or monopolise
    copyright, or criminal acts involving the work.

    ============================= DEFINITIONS ==============================

     "Work" means any form of creative work protected under the Copyright
    Act.

    entities that have existed, exist, or will exist. In a narrower sense,
    it refers to all natural persons or legal entities who have acquired
    this pledge or work.

     Expressions such as "anything" refer to all acts concerning the work.
    This includes the exercise and non-exercise of all rights that the
    copyright holder may exclusively possess under the Copyright Act.

     "As is" refers to the work in its created, unaltered state. This
    includes any defects, errors, omissions, or unknown issues within the
    work.
